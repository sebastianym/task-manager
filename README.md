# ðŸ“˜Task Manager

This web app allows you to manage your daily tasks efficiently. You can create and view a list of tasks, marking each one as completed once you've finished it. The app uses localStorage to ensure that your data remains persistent, even if you close the browser or reload the page. This way, you'll always have access to your updated to-do list and won't lose the progress of your activities.
